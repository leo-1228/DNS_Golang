# workspace is a directory which contains the domains file. 
# all outputs like output.csv, errors.txt and invalids.txt will be stored in this directory.
#
# CAUTION: 
# As you know, this service's job is a long-running process, 
# so the service is designed to be able to continue the process in the event that service is interrupted.
# To achieve this feature, a file called .workspace.lock will be created automatically, DO NOT EDIT/DELETE it. 
workspace: .

# The service will read "batch_size" lines at once and will process them concurrently; 
# Please be careful about setting this value; a higher number sometimes leads to lower performance.
# The service will persist the process result after all read domains get processed,
# which means a higher number is equal to a higher risk of losing the result in the event of any interruption.
#
# The recommended number is between 10 and 20.
batch_size: 10

# domains_file is the name of file which contains the domains. 
# this parameter does not accept path.

# spaces determines valid spaces. it can not be empty

# actions is the list of all actions that you want to be applied to the domain variations calculation.
# you can simply remove which one you want.
actions:
 - homoglyph
 - addition
 - bitsquatting
 - hyphenation
 - insertion
 - omission
 - repetition
 - replacement
 - transposition
 - vowelSwap
 #- dictionary

# by setting homoglyph_double to true, the homoglyph action will be applied twice. (like the python version)
homoglyph_double: false

# dictionary_file is the name of file which contains the dictionary. 
# this parameter does not accept path.
# you can set an empty value in case of removing the "dictionary" from the actions.

# log_mode:
# possible values: 
#   realtime: you will see all logs in realtime. 
#   none: you will see no logs at all.
#   X: you can set a number in seconds greater than 0. in this case you will see the logs every X seconds.
#
# CAUTION: 
# Using the "realtime" value or a lower number of X for this parameter will reduce the performance dramatically.

# The recommended number is between 5 and 10.

# by setting save_invalid_domains to true, all invalid domains will be stored in the invalids.txt
